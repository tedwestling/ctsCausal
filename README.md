This is an R package for nonparametric causal inference with continuous/non-discrete exposures. 

This is an active area of research, so new methods will be added to the package as they become available and are implemented.

Every effort is made to make the code stable, but please let me know or open an issue in Github if you find a bug or problem in the code.

To install this `R` package, first install the `devtools` package. Then type:

```
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("tedwestling/ctsCausal")
```
