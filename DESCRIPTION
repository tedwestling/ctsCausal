Title: Methods for Causal Inference with Continuous Exposures
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ted Westling
Maintainer: Ted Westling <twestling@math.umass.edu>
Description: This package contains methods for causal inference with continuous
    and other non-discrete treatments/exposures. These methods are primarily 
    nonparametric in nature and design. causalNullTest performs a test
    that the causal dose response curve is flat. causalDoseResponse (not yet 
    implemented) will contain methods for estimating causal dose-response 
    curves. cmdSuperLearner is a method for SuperLearner-based estimation of
    conditional mixed continuous/discrete density functions.
